# simsun-space

This font, named "simsun-space", only contains the U+0020 character SPACE.
Made by [FontForge](https://github.com/fontforge/fontforge).

Created as a workaround for an [issue](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/37100) concerning half-width space's display width in VSCode when SimSun applied.
One may prepend its name to the font family list, e.g. set
```
"editor.fontFamily": "simsun-space,simsun,monospace"
```
in settings.json.

This repo is in coincidence with the work of [xhawk18](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/188774?issuecomment-1907605287#issuecomment-1907605287).
